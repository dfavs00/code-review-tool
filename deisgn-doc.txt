AI Code Review Tool Design Document

1. Overview:
   - The AI code review tool analyzes code changes between the current local Git branch and another specified branch.
   - It provides automated feedback using a large language model (LLM) to assess code quality, potential issues, and best practices.

2. Functional Requirements:
   - Git Integration:
     - Fetch and analyze diffs between the current branch and a target branch.
   - Code Analysis:
     - Extract relevant code changes from the Git diff.
     - Use an LLM to analyze the changes and provide feedback.
   - Feedback Generation:
     - Generate structured feedback in natural language.
     - Provide actionable suggestions for improvements.
     - Categorize feedback (e.g., best practices, security concerns, performance optimizations).
   - User Interface:
     - Command-line interface (CLI) for initiating reviews.
     - Option to output results in different formats (console, markdown, JSON).
     - Future expansion to a GUI if needed.

3. Non-Functional Requirements:
   - Performance:
     - Optimize requests to the LLM for cost and speed efficiency.
   - Scalability:
     - Support multiple programming languages via LLM prompts.
   - Security:
     - Ensure no sensitive code is exposed when using cloud-based LLM APIs.
   - Compatibility:
     - Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux).

4. Architecture:
   - Components:
     - **Git Client Interface**: Fetches diffs between branches.
     - **Diff Parser**: Extracts changed files and relevant code snippets.
     - **LLM Integration**: Sends structured prompts to an LLM API or local model.
     - **Feedback Processor**: Formats and structures LLM responses.
     - **User Interface**: CLI tool for execution and output.
   - Workflow:
     - Fetch Git diff → Parse changes → Format structured prompt → Send to LLM → Generate feedback → Display results.

5. Tools and Technologies:
   - **Language:** Python (due to extensive ecosystem support for Git, APIs, and CLI tools).
   - **Git Integration:** GitPython or native Git CLI commands.
   - **LLM API:** OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, or a self-hosted Llama 3 model.
   - **Prompt Engineering:** Custom templates to ensure effective feedback generation.
   - **User Interface:** CLI using argparse, rich (for better formatting), or Typer.
   - **Optional Local Execution:** Ollama or GPT4All for running models locally.

6. Future Enhancements:
   - CI/CD pipeline integration for automated reviews in pull requests.
   - Fine-tuning prompts based on user feedback.
   - Support for additional output formats (e.g., PR comments, GitHub Actions integration).
   - Potential GUI for enhanced usability.
